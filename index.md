A note is one tone played at a single pitch. When you strike a piano key, or pluck a guitar string, you are playing a note.

Notes have letter names, like A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

```js
alert('Hello World');
```

## Chord

```js
alert('Hello World');
```


## Interval

An interval is the distance between two notes.

```js
alert('Hello World');
```
